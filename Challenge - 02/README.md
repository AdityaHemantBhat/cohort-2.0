# Daily Challenge 02: Cloning "Nothing" Design

![Design Reference](image.webp)

## Project Overview
This project is a solution to the "Daily Challenge 02" where the goal was to clone the "Nothing" design using only HTML and CSS. The design reference is provided in `image.webp`, and the completed clone can be seen in `Clone_nothing.png`.

- **Responsive:** The layout adapts to different screen sizes for a seamless experience on all devices.
- **No JavaScript:** Built entirely with HTML and CSS.
- **Minimal & Clean:** Focused on replicating the design as closely as possible.
